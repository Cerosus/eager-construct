#Eager Construct Telegram Bot

Search for a card by enclosing its name with [[ ]] in your message. You can search for multiple cards at once, in which case the search results will be grouped into an album. The message DOES NOT need to only contain bracketed terms: you may mention the card as part of a regular message.
Example: What's so great about [[Saheeli]] and [[Felidar Guardian]]?

You can also search for other characteristics using Scryfall's search syntax.
Common options include:
 Oracle text     o:
 Type            t:
 Color           c:
 Color identity  id:
 Cost            m:
Example: [[o:"can't attack you" t:enchantment c:r]]"

One last feature is the ability to display multiple results by adding the 'l:' operator in the search. The maximum number of results from one such search is 10.
